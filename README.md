# Brightness-And-Volume-ahk

Auto Hot Key script to enable increasing/decreasing volume and brightness on Windows 10 using:
ALT + Arrow UP/DOWN (volume)
ALT + Arrow RIGHT/LEFT (brightness)

I initially tried to make this ever since I bought an older model of logitech keyboard to replace my crappy built-in laptop keyboard. I noticed that my keyboard do not have FN button nor media buttons. Because of that, it was difficult trying to increase volume/brightness when I was using fullscreen softwares such as videos and games. So I tried searching for a way to fix this problem. Which brings me to using auto hot key script.

However, in every forum and source code that I found, none of them gives me the satisfaction of the "perfect solution". So all I had to do was to make my own ahk script from scratch, the one that gives you the feeling of not using a script and more like system commands.

Due to the nature of scripts not being part of the system itself, it has to be executed manually in order for it to activate every time you boot your computer. Alternatively, you can also put this file as part of the startup programs so you wouldn't have to run it every single time.
